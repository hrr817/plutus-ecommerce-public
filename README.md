*A miserly failed attempt to make an ecommerce website with Commerce JS. 
Though you can checkout my code.* 

> I can look back at this project later to keep track of my skills (how

**Technologies used:**

 - SASS - preprocessor for css (makes writing css easier)
 - Redux - for state management (it is a big project and will scale
   later on so redux and also to learn redux with react)
 - Commerce JS - built on this, build serverless ecommerce through their
   API. (thought it might difficult for beginners as there is no
   community for Commerce JS; shopify has one).
 - framer-motion library - for animations (physics based), thought it is
   quite heavy; if possible opt a smaller library
 - React forms - a really good library for creating forms, almost no
   re-renders (probably storing states in ref hook)
